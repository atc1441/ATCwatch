# ATCwatch  -WatcH
Custom Arduino C++ firmware for the P8 and PineTime plus many more DaFit Smartwatches

About 150â€“200uA standby current consumtion. Currently 92 Hours Runtime with heavy notification and usage!
Basic menu system and notification working.

If you want to use it on PineTime comment the #define P8WATCH to enable the PineTime Pinout. 
For other watches please try to check the pinout of them and make changes as needed.

Use this portable Arduino version:

Here is a manual on how to use it:

Unzip, open Arduino.exe, open the ATCwatch.ino file and compile. Done.
Simply select the DaFit as the board and click on compile. You will get an Update file you can flash in the Arduino folder.

Please make sure you have always an option to go back to Bootloader somehow. I can only suggest to have one watch opened and connected an SWD St-Link V2 to it to develop on that.


**This can be flashed without opening the Watch with this Repo https://github.com/atc1441/DaFlasherFiles and the DaFlasher app from the PlayStore (Android):**

This firmware is meant to be used with the D6Notification App from the PlayStore (Android):

## FAQ / Errors
#### Code does not compile / Arduino puts out errors.
---> This code is meant to be used with the D6Arduino.rar on Windows and is tested that way. Sometimes I make changes to it so you need to update that also when getting the newest firmware. I will try to add information when you need to update it but can not guarantee it, so just try an update if it does not work.

The latest update that needs the newest D6Arduino.rar file is this: https://github.com/atc1441/ATCwatch/commit/0dd3138d10d5c8f1a776ad1b7f1d4819d686e46f
